\title{How \underline{Not} to Program Your GPUs.}
\author{Muhammad Osama}

\thispagestyle{empty}

This seminar is a direct result of my dissertation work titled ``Load Balancing on the GPU,'' a GPU-based load-balancing programming model for fine-grained computations. This talk is intended as a tutorial, in which I will present lessons learned on how \emph{not} to program a GPU. I will focus on three key aspects: performance, program abstractions and software engineering. Together we will build the fastest General Matrix-Multiplication (GEMM) kernel, ever.

% Memory is everything, but load-balancing is better.
% Beautiful abstractions and how to build them.
% Code that lasts.
